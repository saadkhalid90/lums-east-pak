          India was reported to be conspiring in East Pakistan. East Pakistan
          provided an opportunity to exercise complete autonomy over the Bay of
          Bengal and link the violent elements of West Bengal with the
          sympathisers of the so-called “Bangla Desh.” Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah-
          Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir- also admonished perils of Indian
          jingoism, claiming that in expressing sympathy for “Bangla Desh,”
          India itself had forgotten its denial of the right of
          self-determination to the people of Kashmir, since the past 23 years.
          At the same time, a German newsman was reported to have revealed the
          farce of ‘Bangla Desh radio,’ claiming that the radio was located in
          India.

          On 2 June, Indira Gandhi was asked by an Indian Parliamentarian,
          Baburao Patel to launch an invasion of West Pakistan. West Pakistan
          was considered as a “fortnight’s meal” for the sophisticated Indian
          army under the command of General Manekshaw. Then, a few days later,
          it was reported that the Indian Army patrol had apprehended 16
          Pakistani nationals from the area opposite Comila and acquired their
          belongings. This depicted that India was preventing bona fide
          Pakistani nationals from returning to East Pakistan.

          On June 3, Indian authorities were reported to have initiated a
          systemic campaign to prevent East Pakistani refugees in India from

          On June 13, Calcutta launched a crackdown on East Pakistan refugees
          who had been shifting to the city. Refugees were perceived to crowd
          roads and the facilities provided to them. On June 15, Indira Gandhi
          announced that India harboured no intention of permitting DPs from
          East Pakistan to settle in her country or return to East Pakistan. She

          settlement that might mean the demise of “Bangla Desh.”

          Meanwhile, the influx of Pakistani nationals increased following
          President Yahya Khan’s assurance of amnesty. Despite emaciated
          conditions and tattered clothes, the returnees were reported to beam
          with ecstatic glee upon returning to their surroundings. On 16 June,
          the Pakistan Government decided to formulate a proposal seeking
          India’s cooperation to facilitate the return and rehabilitation of DPs
          in East Pakistan. At the same time, DPs confirmed incidents of
          atrocities, coercion and intimidation by India.

          India, to return to their homes in East Pakistan. Citizens belonging
          to minority communities were stressed to express no hesitation, as
          they were to be treated as equal citizens, with promises of full
          protection.
