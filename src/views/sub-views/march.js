        <SectionHeading heading="Postponement of National Assembly Session" />
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On March 1, the National Assembly session was postponed by the
          Pakistan’s People Party Chairman, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.
          <span className={`jang ${styles.jang}`}>
            This was done on Mar 2 by Yahya
          </span>
          as he wanted to continue political dialogue with Mujibur rahman, the
          Awami League leader.
          <span className={`jang ${styles.jang}`}>
            On Mar 3 Martial Law administrators are also put in charge of the
            provinces.
          </span>
          He pleaded for the postponement of constitution framing for a period
          of 120 days in the Legal Framework Order, so there could be room for
          productive discussion. He further supported autonomy for all provinces
          insofar as it did not imperil state security, claimed that the
          election results had reflected West Pakistan peoples’ disagreement
          with the Six Points, and favoured a strong centre as solution to the
          emerging political crisis. Moreover, Bhutto expressed resentment over
          Awami League’s demand for Defence and Foreign Affairs to remain under
          the Centre, but foreign trade to be transferred to the provinces.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            6 points were criticised for trying to rupture the relationship
            between the two Wings.
          </span>
          The postponement of the NA session was additionally emphasised by
          Mufti Mahmood, General Secretary of Jamiatul Ulemae Islam (Hazarvi
          Group).
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            Mujib had been willing to ‘do whatever is necessary for the
            existence of Pakistan’ before the postponement, which to him seemed
            a step back.
          </span>
        </p>
        <SectionHeading heading="Reaction to the Postponement of the NA Session" />
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          Mujibur rahman fiercely opposed the postponement of the N.A session,
          and in response to Mujib’s call, a 10-hour curfew was imposed in
          Dacca.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            There were violent protests and riots in Dhaka. On 4 Mar, curfew was
            imposed on Rangpur, Khulna and Sylhet.
          </span>
          While discussing the exploitation of the people of Bangladesh, he
          asserted that Socialism would resolve their problems. There were
          rampant economic problems in the province with an unemployed
          population of 70 lakh people. Over the past 23 years, not even 15% of
          its people had acquired positions in the Central Government or Armed
          Forces. Despite earning a bulk of the foreign exchange, 80% of the
          foreign exchange was spent on West Pakistan.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            Mujib had said that if you cannot create a constitution, let us
            create one.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          Bhutto announced that he would be willing to visit East Pakistan and
          resolve the constitutional crisis with Sheikh Mujibur rahman. His
          policy of postponement was facing strong condemnation and he was being
          blamed for violating democracy and plunging the country into a state
          of unrest.

        <SectionHeading heading="President Yahya Khan Attempts at Resolving the Constitutional Crisis" />
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On March 4, President Yahya Khan invited 12 elected
          parliamentary-group leaders from the National Assembly to meet at
          Dacca and resolve the constitutional crisis. However, Mujib rejected
          the invitation.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            He said we are being blackmailed and will not collaborate with
            someone who has killed innocent people
          </span>
          and demanded withdrawal of forces and transfer of power, while
          emphasising peaceful satyagraha. Life in East Pakistan remained
          paralysed as people observed a “Day of Mourning.” In response to
          Mujib’s demands for withdrawal of forces from Dacca and transfer of
          power to the people’s representatives, the Martial Law Authorities
          decided to withdraw the army to the barracks. In the meanwhile,
          protests continued in the Eastern wing, while Bhutto’s action met with
          increasing criticism for being inherently undemocratic, and disrupting
          peace in the country.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On March 7, President Yahya announced that the inaugural session of
          the National Assembly would occur on March 25, and hoped for a
          patriotic response.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            PPP agrees to attend the 25 March session, Bhutto says that some
            amendments in the 6 points will have to be made.
          </span>
          The 5-day protest against the postponement of the NA session also came
          to an end in East Pakistan. However, Mujib announced that the League
          would attend the NA session if its 4-Point demand was accepted. The
          four points included: the end of Martial Law, transfer of power to the
          elected, enquiry into the riots, and the return of the Army to the
          barracks.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            Under the pressure of constant demands to visit E. Pakistan,
          </span>
          President Yahya eventually decided to visit East Pakistan and discuss
          the impending political crisis with Sheikh Mujibur rahman- his
          decision was welcomed by the Awami League.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            Bhutto was being accused by other politicians, such as Daultana, for
            causing the crisis because of his inflexibility. Riots in the
            previous week in E. Pak had left 172 dead and 358 injured. Bhutto
            had pleaded to Mujib that the country must be saved at any cost,
            while Mujib had said that in Bangladesh, the will of the people will
            be privileged. PPP supported Mujib’s demands for the return of the
            army to the barracks and for an investigation into the riots. Riots,
            prison unrest, bombings continued in E. Pak.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            While Bhutto being criticised by many prominent politicians for his
            inflexibility. Some blamed the industrialists for the exploitation
            of E. Pak, and not W. Pak. Others took a hardline approach that the
            E. Wing had contributed very little to the total earnings of
            Pakistan since 1947, and we should take those billions back from
            them.

        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            On 14 March, students in E. Pak. protest outside the AL’s office
            against the violence meted out to non-Bengalis. On 15 March, Bhutto
            proposes that power should be transferred to the majority parties in
            East and West Pak, a suggestion for which he is heavily criticised.

        <SectionHeading heading="Yahya Khan in Dacca" />
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On March 16, President Yahya Khan arrived in Dacca and held the first
          round of talks with Awami League Chief, Sheikh Mujibur rahman. To
          overcome the present constitutional deadlock, Yahya Khan agreed to
          accept the 4-Point demands laid down by Sheikh Mujibur rahman.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            A commission to investigate the deployment of army in E Pak formed
            on 18 March. In the meantime, violence against non-Bengalis
            continues in E. Pak; demands are made for the AL to protect them,
            compensate them for their losses, and investigate the riots and
            violence. Bhutto initially refused to join Yahya for talks with
            Mujib, threatening that if the constitution is not formed in an
            adequate manner, they’d have to display the power of the people. On
            20 Mar, Yahya and Bhutto agree on a transfer of power as optimism
            rose that the crisis could be resolved in the next 2 days. Violence,
            curfews in E. Pak. Sentiments against W. Pak grew harder as
            different political parties including the Jamaat e Islami bemoaned
            the unprecedented-in-history violence on democratic subjects as was
            done on E. Pak people.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On 22 March, Bhutto flew to East Pakistan. While attempting to reach
          an agreement on the issue of provincial autonomy, he questioned the
          Awami League’s demand for autonomy and expressed that the powers
          sought by the Awami League resembled sovereignty.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            On 23 Mar, Yahya postpones the NA session again following the
            suggestions of both the big parties. While Bhutto expresses
            satisfaction over his talks with Mujib, the latter is adamant that
            ‘We are on the right, victory will be ours.
          </span>
          Sheikh Mujibur rahman expressed concern over the “regrettable delay
          in resolving the crisis politically.”
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            Bhutto says that although he sympathises with the people of E. Pak,
            he has to do what’s best for Pakistan. On 26 Mar, the army enters
            Dhaka, while firing in Rangpur, Chatgaam, and Sayedpur leaves 110
            dead. At the same time, there are numerous clashes between crowds
            and the army. Mujib says that we will be free or die trying to be,
            but we will not bow.
          </span>
          He announced the observation of another general strike on 27th March
          throughout Bangladesh to protest against the firings that had recently
          occurred in Bangladesh.

        <SectionHeading heading="Banning of Awami League" />
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On March 27, the military dictatorship banned political activity and
          outlawed the Awami League, in attempts to tackle the situation in East
          Pakistan. Moreover, complete press censorship was imposed, and the
          Armed Forces were applauded for performing their patriotic duty.
          <span className={styles.jang}>
            Upon reaching Karachi Bhutto proclaimed that Pakistan had been
            saved. Both Yahya and Bhutto accuse Mujib of having always wanted
            the splitting up of the country. On 28 Mar, Sheikh Mujibur rahman
            was arrested from his house and the Army assumed complete control of
            East Pakistan. Pakistan also strongly protested against Indian
            interference in its internal affairs, a protest rejected by India.
            28 March: The mystery of the secret radio exposed: “India has
            established a radio station outside Calcutta from where it publishes
            false information about the situation in E Pak. It is called ‘Voice
            of Bangladesh’. On 29th banks resumed their normal service and peace
            was told as restored. On 30, a big strength of the Indian army
            gathered near the E. Pak border. As reports of life returning to
            normalcy began pouring in, India accepted responsibility for the
            Dhaka radio episode.
