        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On 1st May, India was reported to have increased aid, including
          military supplies, food supplies and training facilities, to agents in
          East Pakistan according to reports published by the “New York Times”
          and “Washington Post”.
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            In the Nawa i Waqt, it was reported that “European newspapers are
            publishing misleading news regarding East Pakistan, and that Indian
            Embassy is shedding crocodile tears to the world”. On the same day,
            the editorial called India out for its role in producing discontent
            in East Pakistan and pushing it towards separation from Pakistan.
            Nawa i Waqt published a full-page special feature which said:
            “Indira Jee, Andu Nabna Chor Do (Indira Jee, stop gritting your
            teeth in chains)”

          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            On 2nd May, two Indian warplanes were detected flying over the
            Rangpore District, in a blatant violation of Pakistan’s airspace.
          </span>
          In response, the Pakistan Government lodged a strong protest with the
          Indian Government. A strongly-worded protest note was drafted, listing
          all the military incidents and incitements against the repeated
          territorial violations by India. The Indian government was informed
          that it had been “systemically creating an atmosphere of confrontation
          with Pakistan.”
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            On 4th May, it was an Indian fighter jets was reported as having

          On 5th May, the East Wing people were reported to be critical of
          separatist ideals, claiming that secession would prelude to slavery to
          India. According to APP’s special correspondent’s reports, a public
          meeting held at an urban village in Khulna concluded with a firm
          resolution to uphold the sanctity and solidarity of Pakistan, and
          thwart India’s attempts at instigation.
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            9th May: At the same time, there were mass protests in East Pakistan
            over Indian aggression.

        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          Then on 11th May in Jessore, armed incursions organised by India
          violated Pakistan’s territorial integrity. Firing on various border
          posts was observed, while India provided substantial logistical
          support to the miscreants. The common pattern in incursions involved
          bursts of mortar and machine-gun fire by Indians, and their immediate
          withdrawal as soon as the Pakistan Army retaliated.
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            On 14th May, India posted seven armed divisions in borders with
            Azaad Kashmir, while on 20th May, Indira Gandhi warned of an
            impending war with Pakistan. On 26th May, it was reported that
            Pakistan sank two ammunition filled ships of India near Chittagong.
            Many were killed, injured, and taken in custody.

        </p>
        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On 26th May, the Government of Pakistan strongly protested against
          India’s “unprovoked threat of armed conflict with Pakistan.” Indira
          Gandhi had said in a statement released earlier on May 19 that India
          was “fully prepared to fight” against Pakistan. Pakistan’s protest
          note to the Indian High Commissioner expressed that India’s aim was to
          create a situation of conflict with Pakistan, and Delhi was urged to
          restrain from pursuing such a dangerous course in politics.
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            On 27th May, Indira said that India will attack Pakistan without
            caring for the views of thebig countries. On 29th May, it was
            reported that India was carrying out preparations for a war on the
            East Pakistan border.

        <p className={styles.view_para_news}>
          On 1st May, Pakistan’s chief delegate to the CENTO conference stressed
          the difficulty in establishing good relations between India and
          Pakistan, following India’s “open interference” in Pakistan’s internal
          affairs. The United Nations Secretary-General U Thant also reached an
          agreement with Yahya Khan to provide humanitarian aid to East
          Pakistan.
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            13 May: At the same time, english Newspapers continued publishing
            inflammatory material against Pakistan. On 24th May, Nawa i Waqt
            posited that the situation in East Pakistan was result of a
            historical alliance of Hindus and English against Muslims.
          </span>
          Later, on 1st June, the World Bank and IMF teams were also due for
          assessing the financial needs of the country and to present
          recommendations to the International Aid-in-Pakistan Consortium which
          had met back in July.

            2nd May: “Me and many Awami league people were patriotic but didn’t
            know the anti-Pakistan intentions of some groups within the league”,
            says S B Zaman.
          </span>
          On May 6, an official expose of a secessionist plot by the Awami
          League was reported. The outlawed Party had set 26 March as the zero
          hour for an armed uprising and the declaration of “The Independent
          Republic of Bangladesh.” The alleged plan was to seize Dacca and
          Chittagong; however, this was jeopardised by the Pakistan Army, which
          made a series of pre-emptive strikes and saved the country. Rather
          interestingly, on May 27, ‘Bangla Desh’ emissaries were reported to be
          seeking aid from Israel’s Prime Minister, Golda Meir.

            1st May: Abdul Qayoom Khan of Muslim League calls for a new election
            in East Pakistan so both wings can get the transfer of power
            together. People’s Party in disarray, ZA Bhutto admits. 2nd May: a
            temporary constitution would be implemented in the country very
            soon; Yahya Khan has prepared. 5 may: Bhutto backs out from calling
            for immediate transfer of power.
          </span>
          On May 9, Bhutto reiterated the need for early power transfer to the
          elected representatives of the people, and asserted that political
          problems could be resolved through rapprochement. On May 24, President
          Yahya Khan also said that he would soon announce a plan for the
          transfer of power to the elected people’s representatives. He
          reiterated that his primary aim was indeed the transfer of power and
          he would fulfil it as conditions further normalised in East Pakistan.
          He also declared that the Government would grant amnesty to all those
          who were “genuinely misled,” but not to those who had rebelled and
          committed crimes such as murders, loot and arson.
          <span className={styles.nwakt}>
            25 May: Yahya Khan gives the estimate of two to three weeks within
            which power would be transferred to ‘representatives of the people’

          By May 23, substantial efforts were being channelled into the
          reactivation of East Wing industries, involving the raising of
          exports. A plethora of far-reaching measures were proposed to maximise
          productivity and raise resources. Life was returning to normalcy in
          Sylhet with the reopening of shops, bazaars and offices. Peaceful
          conditions prevailed in Khulna and Jessore too. The Governor and
          Martial Law Administrator, L.T-Gen Tikka Khan expressed satisfaction
          to see the shipping and loading operations at Chalna for the shipment
          of jute and newsprint. All schools were also set to open in Sylhet
          from May 31st. In fact, ideological education was proposed by the
          Secretary-General of the Jamat-i-Islami Chaudhry Rehmat Elahi. He
          suggested a four-point programme fully incorporating mass media and
          the education system to espouse Islamic ideology to preempt future
          crisis in East Pakistan, insisting that Islam was the sole link that
          could tie people from various regions of the country.
