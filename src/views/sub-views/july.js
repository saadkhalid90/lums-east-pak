            The UK govt refuses to recognise Bangladesh, an official claiming
            that in Bangladesh, people fear each other, not the army. On 3 July,

          On July 1, the Pakistan Government approached the UN
          Secretary-General, U Thant and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
          Prince Sadruddin, as well as the Governments of friendly countries to
          call on the Indian Government for the release and repatriation of
          Pakistani nationals, who had penetrated into India due to political
          turmoil in East Pakistan. The DPs were reported to have been
          languishing in Indian jails.

          The U.N drafted a plan of $28.2m for rehabilitation work in East
          Pakistan. Ismat T. Kitani, the U.N Assistant Secretary-General for
          Inter-Agency Affairs, also recommended that Pakistan should be
          provided with river craft, trucks, motor-tugs and jeeps to counter
          communication problems.

            At the same time, Pakistan also protested against the statements of
            some members of the British Parliamentary Delegation in E Pak who
            had said that they wouldn’t recommend the refugees going back to E
            Pak. Debates about whether aid should continue to be given to
            Pakistan take place in the US elected houses. On 5 July it is
            reported that Pakistan leaves the Commonwealth because of its
            anti-Pakistan propaganda. Pak continues to condemn propaganda
            against it in the international media; there is an unholy alliance
            between Indian and Britain at work; only the US media has dealt with
            the situation in a responsible manner. Sooran Singh admits defeat in
            his attempt to pressurise Pakistan, while reports claim that Britain
            is giving passports to the E Pak living there and sending them to
            India.

            On 5 July, it is also reported that while Yahya wants the return of
            refugees, India has begun the process of transferring them to
            far-flung areas within India to hinder their return. On 18 July,
            75000 refugees return from India, report that they found nothing but
            hunger, disease, and death in Indian camps. It was also reported
            that India has begun treating Indian Muslims as Pakistanis and has
            begun forcing them out. On 26 July, 90000 refugees return to
            Pakistan.

          On July 22, Pakistan accepted a U.N proposal for the stationing of U.N
          civilian personnel in both Pakistan and India for the repatriation of
          displaced persons to East Pakistan. India was reported to have
          rejected the proposal however. The U.S Under-Secretary of State John
          Irwin informed the Senate that President Yahya Khan had welcomed the
          U.N proposal of posting observers on the East Pakistan-India border,
          whereas India had been intransigent. There were also reports of raids
          and violent clashes on the borders, which inevitably curtailed the
          return the DPs.
