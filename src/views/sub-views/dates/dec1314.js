          In a letter to the UN Secretary General U Thant, Indian Prime Minister
          Indira Gandhi said "there can be a ceasefire and withdrawal of Indian
          armed forces" if Pakistan withdraws its troops from Bangladesh and
          reaches a political solution with the leaders there. She added if
          there was an assurance that the basic causes would be objectively
          examined, India "will not be found wanting in offering its utmost
          cooperation".

          establish a beachhead somewhere near Chittagong. The Chittagong Port
          was severely pounded from the sea and the air. Many ships were damaged
          and sunk in the river completely blocking the shipping channel.
